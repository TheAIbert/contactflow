## Full Stack ReactJS with Spring Boot

I have developed a comprehensive full-stack application utilizing Spring Boot on the backend and ReactJS on the frontend. This project demonstrates my proficiency in modern web development technologies and frameworks, ensuring a robust, scalable, and user-friendly application. Below is a detailed description of the technologies and features implemented in the project.

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- **Spring Boot**: Leveraged Spring Boot to build a RESTful API service, streamlining the development process with its powerful ecosystem and convention-over-configuration approach.
- **Spring Web**: Implemented RESTful endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Spring JPA**: Utilized Spring Data JPA for object-relational mapping and database interaction, simplifying complex database operations and queries.
- **PostgreSQL**: Integrated PostgreSQL as the relational database management system, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval.
- **Lombok**: Employed Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate code, improving code readability and maintainability.
- **File Handling**: Developed features for file upload and automatic deletion, providing efficient file management within the application.
- **Pagination**: Implemented pagination for handling large datasets, improving performance and user experience by loading data in manageable chunks.

### Frontend (ReactJS)
- **React**: Built the frontend using React, taking advantage of its component-based architecture to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **React Hooks**: Utilized React Hooks for state management and side effects, ensuring a clean and functional approach to component logic.
- **React Router DOM**: Implemented routing with React Router DOM to enable navigation between different pages and components within the application.
- **React Toastify**: Integrated React Toastify for notifications, enhancing user experience with real-time feedback and alerts.

### Integration
- **API Integration**: Connected the React frontend with the Spring Boot backend via RESTful APIs, enabling seamless data exchange and synchronization between the two layers.
- **User Experience**: Focused on delivering a user-friendly experience by incorporating efficient state management, responsive design, and intuitive navigation.

### Project Highlights
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Developed end-to-end functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- **Efficient File Management**: Implemented robust mechanisms for file upload and automatic cleanup, ensuring optimal storage utilization.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed the application to handle scalability and performance, with features like pagination for large datasets.
- **Seamless Navigation**: Enhanced user experience with smooth and intuitive navigation, powered by React Router DOM.

### Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring JPA, PostgreSQL, Lombok
- **Frontend**: React, React Hooks, React Router DOM, React Toastify

This project exemplifies my ability to build a full-stack application from scratch, integrating modern technologies and best practices to deliver a high-quality, scalable solution. It showcases my expertise in both frontend and backend development, making me a strong candidate for the Full Stack Java Software Engineer role.
